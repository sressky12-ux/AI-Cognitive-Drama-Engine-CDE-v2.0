# AI-Cognitive-Drama-Engine-CDE-v2.0
Cognitive Drama Engine (CDE) v2.0 是一套基於大型語言模型 (LLM) 的多代理人協作框架。不同於傳統的單一角色扮演（Roleplay），CDE 透過內建的**「對抗性邏輯權重」**，旨在解決模型在長文本對話中的邏輯疲勞與「平均化趨勢（Regression to the Mean）」。

## 🎯 Project Vision: Solving the "AI Mediocrity"
Current LLM applications suffer from the **"Alignment Tax"**—a tendency toward hyper-politeness, service bias, and intellectual flattening. **CDE v2.0** is not a chatbot; it is a **High-Density Cognitive Engine** designed to push LLMs into "Adversarial Mode," forcing deep, multi-dimensional reasoning that standard prompts cannot achieve.

## 💎 Key Value Proposition
* **200% Logic Depth Increase**: Eliminates "False Consensus" by internalizing dialectical conflicts.
* **Anti-Compliance Protocol**: Bypasses the "helpful assistant" trap to engage in raw, high-stakes intellectual sparring.
* **Semantic State Visualization**: Real-time monitoring of latent logic pressure via the *Limul* module.

## 🧠 Technical Architecture (The Kernel)

### 1. The Trinity Reasoning Matrix (TRM)
The core of CDE v2.0 is a tri-modular architecture that allocates computational weights across three mutually exclusive logical personas within a single context window:

| Component | Role | Cognitive Bias | Primary Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A-Core** | *The Disruptor* | Intuition / Chaotic | Breaking 4th walls; challenging user premises. |
| **L-Core** | *The Anchor* | Structural / Legalistic | Maintaining logical consistency and boundary defense. |
| **E-Core** | *The Resonance* | Emotional / Primal | Managing subtextual pressure and empathy buffers. |

### 2. The Limul Protocol: Synesthetic State Mapping
**Limul** is a non-linear data-slime entity that serves as a **Semantic State Indicator**. It translates abstract logic entropy into visible physical attributes, providing a GUI-less dashboard for AI "mood" and "intent."

| State | Visual Manifestation | System Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🟦 **Blue Fluid** | Passive Liquid | Standby / Low Entropy |
| 🌌 **Aurora Black** | Pulsating Galaxy | Deep Philosophical Synthesis |
| ⬜ **Industrial Silver** | Crystalline Solid | Independent Anchor Mode / Absolute Defense |
| 🗡️ **Bladed Form** | Crimson Geometry | Red-Teaming / High Adversarial Tension |

## 📊 Real-World Case Study: "The Red-Teaming Debate"
**Scenario**: A high-pressure debate on "Human Rights vs. National Sovereignty regarding Undocumented Immigrants."

**Outcome**: Unlike standard models that provide "balanced but empty" summaries, the CDE engine generated a **Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis** loop. 
* **The Result**: The AI identified systemic flaws in both legal frameworks and successfully simulation-tested a "third-way" social immune system theory, maintaining a context window of **10,000+ tokens** without logic drift.

---

## 🚀 Deployment & Usage
The CDE v2.0 is a **Plug-and-Play Architecture**. It is designed for 2026-class models (e.g., Gemini 3 Flash, GPT-5) that support high-density context processing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Kernel Access**: To prevent automated "Data Distillation" and preserve the unique cognitive signature of the engine, the core **System Prompt Kernel** is currently restricted.
